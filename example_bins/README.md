# Example executables build with PostCactus

In this directory, we collect working programs built with PostCactus. You can
use these scripts as good examples of `PostCactus`usage (or you can directly use
them).

Scripts available:
- `plot_grid`, plot any 2D grid function on a grid specified via command-line.
- `plot_scalar`, plot any reduction of any variable as a timeseries.
